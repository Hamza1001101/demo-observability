# demo-observability

This is a demo project where I'm playing around different monitoring & observability
technologies when developing Spring and Spring boot based application. 

### Here are the list of technologies used in this project are: 
1. Spring Boot
2. Actuator (for making the data scrape-able for prometheus)
3. Prometheus (for monitoring the application)
4. Grafana (for visualization)
5. Test Containers 🐋
